How to save the results in the reversed alphabetical order in each output file?

I customized a new class called "NewText" which contains a compareTo() function that can return the word in the reversed alphabetical order. Then I changed some functions such as toString(), so the output should contain single word. Also, I modifiied the mapper and reducer class in order to matching the "NewText" data format.
